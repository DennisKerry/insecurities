what is p4 code?
P4 (Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors) is a domain-specific programming language designed for defining 
how network devices (such as switches, routers, and firewalls) process packets. Unlike traditional fixed-function network 
devices that have predefined behaviors, P4 allows network operators to program the data plane, enabling custom packet processing logic.

Key Features of P4:
Protocol Independence: P4 does not assume any specific networking protocol (e.g., Ethernet, IPv4, TCP). Instead, 
users define how packets are parsed and processed.
Target Independence: P4 programs can run on different hardware and software platforms, including programmable switches, 
network interface cards (NICs), and software-defined networking (SDN) environments.
Reconfigurability: P4 allows modifying packet processing logic after deployment, 
unlike traditional networking hardware with fixed behavior.
Table-Driven Processing: P4 defines packet processing using match-action tables, 
making it efficient for implementing policies like access control, load balancing, and network telemetry.
